    <releaseNotes>
      2.0.1-beta
        1) Added the ability to update a user group name/description
        2) Added the ability to update a credential value

      2.0.2-beta
        1) Added the ability to find user groups by their association to a specific credential value

      2.0.3-beta
        1) Added a non strongly named version of the DLL so people can pick which one they want!

      2.0.4-beta
        1) Added a better method for getting all of the user groups associated to a credential value

      2.0.5-beta
        1) Changed the Factory so the register method for types are public so I can actually mock/stub things outside of the LAF code base ;-)

      2.0.6-beta
        1) Changed the creential value ID so it is no longer internal only

      2.0.7-beta
        1) Added a new method for finding lots of credential values at the same time based on the urn and the value

      2.0.8-beta
        1) Changed the code base to use V2 version of the certain stored procedures to limit the risk to any other projects!

      2.0.9-beta
        1) Added in the missing references for the audit service
      2.0.10
        Release build
      2.0.11
        1) Added the ability to switch the caller provider to a non HttpContext aware one so the audit will work in console applications etc.
        - Do this by adding "LAF_UseNonHttpCallerProvider" to the application settings with the value of "true"
      2.0.12-13
        1) Changed the isolation levels for transactions
      2.0.14

        2) Sorted out the audit for saving a credential value/user group
      2.0.15
        1) Changed the application task to return a full blown application instead of an application ID. Much more useful!

      2.0.17
        1) Added the ability to delete user groups and their associated relationships
